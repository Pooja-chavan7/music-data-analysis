This project focuses on analyzing a relational SQL database for a fictional digital music store. 
The database contains detailed information about customers, invoices, tracks, albums, genres, artists, and employees â€” offering rich opportunities for business and customer insights.

The primary goal of this analysis is to extract actionable insights by writing optimized SQL queries that answer key business questions, such as:
Who are the top-spending customers by country?
What are the most popular music genres and best-selling artists?
Which cities generate the most revenue?
What customer and sales trends can support future marketing or sales strategies?

Using advanced SQL techniques like joins, aggregations, window functions, CTEs, and subqueries, this project highlights the importance of data-driven decision-making in a music business context.
It demonstrates how structured query language (SQL) can be used to derive meaningful insights from complex datasets in real-world scenarios.
